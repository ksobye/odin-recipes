        <p>Can't fit a whole egg in your mouth? Try beating it into submission for maximum egg eating efficiency!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>6 tbs water</li>
            <li>0,5 tbs salt</li>
            <li>0,25 tbs black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter for your pan</li>
            <li>2 tbs chopped fresh chives</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cook it:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Break eggs into a bowl, whisk together with water, salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a pan at medium heat, pour egg mixture when the butter stops complaining</li>
            <li>Push egg mixture toward the middle of the pan as it hardens</li>
            <li>Turn heat off and let the eggs finish cooking. They will continue to cook/harden after you take it off the stove, so make sure not to overcook them</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with finely chopped chives</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you really feel like you need to, you may plop a big knob of butter into the pan and cook until brown, then pour it into the poor egg mix before cooking. Tastes good, but at what cost?</p>
